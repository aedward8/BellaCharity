              The Bella Charityâ€™s mission is to save and improve lives wherever
              possible. Ultimately, The Bella Charity aims to create a
              well-functioning sanctuary where animals can be rescued,
              sheltered, and properly cared for. In addition to this long-term
              goal, The Bella Charity is actively pursuing projects to help
              animals. A few of the projects include: Create a Mobile
              Application to easily connect adoptable and foster-able pets to
              people. A link to download from the App store will be available
              soon. Create a network of foster homes, veterinarians, and animal
              care workers to house and aid animals in need.
