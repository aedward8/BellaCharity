          The Bella Charityâ€™s mission is to save and improve lives wherever
          possible. Ultimately, The Bella Charity aims to create a
          well-functioning sanctuary where animals can be rescued, sheltered,
          and properly cared for. In addition to this long-term goal, The Bella
          Charity is actively pursuing projects to help animals. A few of the
          projects include: Create a Mobile Application to easily connect
          adoptable and foster-able pets to people. A link to download from the
          App store will be available soon. Create a network of foster homes,
          veterinarians, and animal care workers to house and aid animals in
          need.
